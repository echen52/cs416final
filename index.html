            Given the increasing effects of climate change, and the high volume of automobiles in the world, we must seek to better understand
            the mileages of various automobiles. There are many factors that can affect the mileage of your car (See:

            city MPGs of automobiles, with respect to just a few of these factors, like engine cylinders, fuel type and the
            make of the vehicle.

    <h2 id="one">How do NBA Teams Compare on Offense and Defense?</h2>
    <p>See how each NBA team performs on offense and defense.
      A zero net rating means the team has a neutral point differential and is expected to win exactly half of their games (41-41 Record).
      Teams with positive net rating are expected to win more than 41 games, and teams with negative net rating are expected to win less than 41 games.
      Hover over each point to see the team. </p>

    <h2 id="three">What is the relationship between 3 Pointers Made/Allowed on Team Offense/Defense?</h2>
    <p>This visualization shows the relationship between the 3 Pointers Made/Allowed on NBA Teams' Offensive/Defensive Efficiency.
      The size of the plotted point represents the number of 3 pointers made while the density represents the number of 3 pointers allowed.
      The overlay of the Offensive/Defensive Efficiency plot shows trends between 3 pointers and team performance.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> 3-point shooting is an important component of NBA team performance. From these visualizations done on the 2024 NBA regular season,
          it appears that there is more impact for 3-point shooting on NBA team offense than there is for minimizing 3-point shooting on NBA team defense.
          A possible explanation is that NBA teams and coaches can better control team offense and shooting with changing lineups and shot selection,
          rather than controlling opponent shooting abilities and how it may affect their team defense.
          Further studies for defense could incorporate rim makes (layups and dunks), since studies have shown that defense is more correlated
          with these shots rather than 3-point shooting.

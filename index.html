           In the NBA, team success can be determined by a few superstar level players. This presentation aims to uncover who the top 20 players in
            the NBA were in 2023 and how they compare to one another on offense and defense. Then, the presentation examines how successful each player's
            team that season. Last, the presentation looks at if the player contributed a key part of that team success.

    <h2>About this Visualization</h2>
    <p>
        This is a narrative visualization created for the CS 498 Data Visualization course. Overview: The above visualization utilizes
        the slideshow narrative visualization technique, while incorporating hybrid elements of the drill-down technique.
        Each slide contains guidance on how to interact with the visualization. The structure of the slides guides users
        from one idea to the next, but there is still room for individual exploration at each stage. We accomplish visual
        consistency by maintaining uniform elements throughout, introducing a mixture of text, image and chart elements,
        and having meaningful colors.
    </p>

    <h3>Scenes</h3>
    <p>
        The scenes themselves are constructed via HTML id tags. Each scene has a unique id that is linked via the buttons.The “Next/Previous”
        buttons allow users to navigate from scene to scene independently, but the structure helps guide the overall narrative.
        Each scene is composed of a unique chart that highlights its own distinct message.
    </p>
    <h3>Annotations</h3>
    <p>
        Annotations remain consistent on the charts, even throughout changes triggered by the interactions. This allows the user
        to have some grounding on the overall message the visualization is trying to communicate. For example, the annotation
        about a relatively good gas mileage stays consistent throughout the vis transformation from highway mileage to city
        mileage. This can help a user better understand which car makes consistently have good mileage across both parameters.
    </p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        The visualizations have a handful of relevant parameters that help the user better explore the data. By interacting with
        JavaScript input features, such as the toggle buttons or the interactive legend in vis2, the user can choose to see
        data about a specific category, or even filter out the datapoints by hovering over specific engine cylinder categories.
        The user input is used as a parameter that controls what the visualization portrays.
    </p>
    <h3>Triggers</h3>
    <p>
        The triggers are implemented via events and callbacks, such as “mouseover”, “mouseout” and “click”. When specific html elements
        experience these events, the callback function is invoked, and we can change the visualization with respect to the
        action indicated by the trigger. The example triggers we have here are the buttons and hovering legend.
